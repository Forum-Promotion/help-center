# Creating a thread

:::info
You must have an account on [Forum Promotion](https://forumpromotion.net/register) to create threads.
:::

A thread is a discussion that's created within a forum, where other community goers are then able to post replies to that discussion.

You can create a thread in it's respective forum simply by going to the forum and clicking on the **Post Thread** button in the top right corner of the forum view.

You may encounter situations where posting might be limited and only members with appropriate permissions can post.

After clicking the **Post Thread** button, you will be asked to fill the thread title and the thread content. Depending on the forum rules, posting images and links may be restricted. See [post/thread formatting](thread-and.md) to learn how to make your thread or post more appealing.

Then click Create thread to have the thread be created in the specified forum.

:::note
In some cases you may need to select a thread prefix, this depends on the forum and what it requires. This is shown durning the process of creating the thread to the left of the thread title input.
