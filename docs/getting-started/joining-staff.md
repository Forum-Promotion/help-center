## Step 1: Accessing the FP Staff Application

1. Open the [FP Staff Application](https://forumpromotion.net/form/forum-promotion-staff-application-form.9/select).

## Step 2: Filling out an Application 

1. Fill out the application once you review the main thread of the team hiring. It is important to review all the requirements and responsibilities of the team you are looking to join. 
2. When filling out your application, make sure you are thorough in your answers. This will give a better look to whoever reviews your application. 

## Step 3: Submitting Application 

1. Once you have completed the forms, click on **Submit** to send your application. 
2. Once your application has been submitted, a private message will be created. Here you will be able to have confirmation that your application was received. 

## Step 5: Application Processing

1. Once the Team Lead has reviewed your application, they will send you a direct message. This is where they will either interview you some more, or let you know that they have decided to go another direction.

If you are not selected on your first application, do not feel discouraged. Continue to remain active within the forums, and show that you are dedicated to the site. You could possibly get chosen the next time a spot has opened up.
