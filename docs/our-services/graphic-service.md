# Graphics Services

The Forum Promotion Graphic Service is an easy way to add more style to your blog, forum, or website. Our Graphics Team Members (GTMs) will make graphics for your communities and promotional content. Graphics can be redeemed for real currency, and in some cased FP Cash **during special events**, which is earned by posting around Forum Promotion.

### How to Request a Graphic
To request a graphic, simply go to the [Graphics Request Forum](https://forumpromotion.net/threads/how-to-request-a-graphic-from-the-graphics-team.182825/) and PM the listed team member to request service. Make sure when requesting a graphic service that you include all important relevant information [style, size, amount of graphics, etc]. Please make sure to read the **Graphic Service Guidelines** within the thread linked above before requesting.
