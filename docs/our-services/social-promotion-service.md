# Social Promotion Service

The Forum Promotion Social Promotion Service is an easy way advertise forum, website, or blog on our social media platforms. Social Promotion Services can be redeemed for FP Cash, which is earned by posting around Forum Promotion.

### How to Request Service
To request a social promotion service, simply go to the [Social Promotion Service Information & Guidelines Thread](https://forumpromotion.net/threads/social-promotion-services-info-guidelines-advertise-your-site-on-our-x-and-fb.183529/) and [Create a new thread](https://forumpromotion.net/forums/social-promotion-services.486/post-thread) to request service. Make sure when requesting the service that you include all important relevant information [site name, site url, social media platform your ordering post on, when you would like it posted, what it should say, and the graphic you would like to use.]. Please make sure to **read the guidelines** in that main thread before requesting.
