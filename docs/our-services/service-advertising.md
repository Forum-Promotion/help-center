# Advertising Services

Our Advertising Services are a additional ways to promote your website. This service goes hand in hand with the [Promotion Directory](https://forumpromotion.net/forum/guide/directory/), but allows you to give your website additional exposure to our members. This article contains information on how to request an ad, and how to best take advantage of the service.

## Signature Ads

**Signature Ads** are displayed in each administrator’s and team leader’s signature throughout the forum on every post they make.

- **Cost:** 50 FP$
- Provides consistent visibility across the forum
- A cost-effective way to promote your site
- Great for long-term exposure and brand recognition

Signature Ads work especially well alongside your Promotion Directory listing and active participation on the forum.

### Tips on Using Advertising Services

- **Request Often:** Ads become more effective the longer they run. After your ads expire, you can request them again. Doing this will not only show your ad to people who haven’t seen it yet, but also will reinforce the message to people who have already seen it and increase the chance that they join your site.
- **Combo with other services:** The more people see your site on FP, the more likely they are to join. If you request an ad, we also recommend that you post your topic in the Promotion Directory, post topics in the What’s Going On section, and include your site link in your signature while actively participating on the forums.
