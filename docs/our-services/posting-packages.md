# Posting Packages

The Forum Promotion Package Service is an easy way to grow activity on your forum or blog. Our Package Team Members (PTMs) will make posts on your forum or blog, to both make your site more active, and to also build content so that other members will find your site more appealing. Posting Packages can be redeemed for FP Cash, which is earned by posting around Forum Promotion.

### How to Request a Package

**Step 1:** To request a package, simply go to the [Package Request Forum](https://forumpromotion.net/forums/posting-services.565/) under the **Official Services** category.

**Step 2:**  [Fill out this form](https://forumpromotion.net/forums/posting-services.565/post-thread). You can also use the **Post Thread** button in the top right to open a new package request. There is a brief template which you will need to fill out first, which asks you the Website URL, Package Type, and Additional Information. 

**Important:** Please make sure to read the [Package Service Guidelines](https://forumpromotion.net/threads/posting-services-guidelines-information.180299/) before requesting.

### Tips for Using the Package Service

- *Reply to posts:* Once the package team is done posting on your forum, we recommend that you reply to the posts they made. That makes your forum even more active, because not only is the package team participating, but you as well.
