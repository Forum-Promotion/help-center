# Site Battles Help Guide

## How Battles Work  

1. **Starting or Joining a Battle**  
   - Navigate to the [Site Battle](https://forumpromotion.net/forums/website-battles.114/) section.  
   - If you want to challenge an existing site, respond to their battle thread with a link to your site.  
   - If no suitable battle exists, [create your own thread](https://forumpromotion.net/forums/website-battles.114/post-thread) using the **[Looking To Battle]** prefix and complete the provided template.  

2. **Battle Request Handling**  
   - Battle starters can **accept or reject** site submissions at their discretion.  
   - If your site is accepted or you accept a challenger, change your thread prefix to **[Poll Needed]**.  

3. **Poll Creation**  
   - A Community Team Member will set up a poll for your battle.  
   - If no poll is created within 24 hours, tag a Community Team Member to notify them.  

4. **Voting and Results**  
   - Polls remain open for **7 days** for members to vote.  
   - After 7 days, the site with the most votes is declared the winner.

2. **Eligibility to Battle**  
   - Only staff members of the entered site can participate in battles.

4. **Voting Requirements**  
   - Voters must meet undisclosed minimum activity and post count requirements to ensure fairness.  

5. **Multiple Battles**

   - In case of a tie, **3 staff members** will privately vote to decide the winner.  

9. **Dead or Inactive Sites**  
   - Sites with dead links, suspended accounts, or closed forums will be removed from the Leaderboard and lose their badges.
